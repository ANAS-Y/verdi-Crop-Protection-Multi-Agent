# verdi-Crop Protection Multi Agent
Verdi is not just a dashboard; it is a Multi-Agent System that acts as an "AI Agronomist in your pocket." Instead of just displaying charts (OLAP), Verdi analyzes crop images in real-time, diagnoses issues, formulates treatment plans based on local weather/soil, and autonomously alerts nearby farms of potential outbreaks to prevent spread.
